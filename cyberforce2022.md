#My Notes

team number: 95


Anomaly1:
We received a message that somone compromised out system, but we were able to aprehend them and get their thumbdrive which has a disk image.
It is in the form of a .E01 file. We were supllied with enough information to know that the file was created by FTK imager.

Starting with ftk imager we are able to mount the image and view the contents. Right away we see that there is a file folde labeled
"Agent of Chaos". Inside are three file folders:

Documents - has s folder that contains varoious things, chiefly another folder that contains emails, as well as a set of instructions...
"
Start by playing the game, and find my first message. That is key to dealing with the images.

When you get that far, take a look at the brochure - use the same keyword from the images.
Lastly, find what's locked behind the Monthly-Update.
Unlock that with what you've found and you've got the stuff.

Using base64 decoder from cyber chef we get...

You won the game! Your reward is a hint - you should probably take a closer look at the pictures folder. There might be something hidden in there. Use the PW / KEYWORD: FULLYCHARGED.

This could be useful, tinme to look closely in the picture folder.

Pictures - Has a bunch of random pitcures
Some of them have data to extract using the Passphrase "FULLYCHARGED"
Here is a list of what has packets:

Spiderweb
